# Validation Framework

## Automated Validation Layers

### Layer 1: Syntax and Linting
- Automatic on every file save
- Configured in .eslintrc / .prettierrc
- Non-negotiable standards
- Must pass before commit

### Layer 2: Unit Tests
- Test individual functions/components
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 80% coverage minimum
- Run on pre-commit hook

### Layer 3: Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use real dependencies where possible
- Verify API contracts
- Run on pull request

### Layer 4: UI Verification
- Playwright screenshots for UI changes
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility checks
- Cross-browser validation

### Layer 5: Business Logic Validation
- Acceptance criteria verification
- Business rule compliance
- Edge case handling
- Performance benchmarks

## Validation Patterns

### For New Features
1. Write acceptance criteria as tests FIRST
2. Implement until tests pass
3. Add edge case tests
4. Verify with screenshot/demo
5. Document validation results

### For Refactoring
1. Capture current behavior with tests
2. Refactor code
3. Ensure all tests still pass
4. Performance comparison
5. Regression verification

### For Bug Fixes
1. Write failing test that reproduces bug
2. Fix until test passes
3. Add related edge case tests
4. Verify fix doesn't break other features
5. Document root cause

## Continuous Validation
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Automated deployment validation
- Production monitoring integration
- Error tracking and alerting

## Human-in-the-Loop Validation
When to involve humans:
- UI/UX subjective decisions
- Business logic interpretation
- Cost/performance tradeoffs
- Security-sensitive changes

How to involve humans efficiently:
- Provide working prototype
- Include screenshot/video
- Summarize what changed and why
- Specific questions only
